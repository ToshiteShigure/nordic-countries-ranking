                <h1>Sweden</h1>
                <p>Sweden (/ˈswiː.dən/; Swedish: Sverige [ˈsvæ̌rjɛ], officially the Kingdom of
                    Sweden (Swedish: Konungariket Sverige [ˈkôːnɵŋaˌriːkɛt ˈsvæ̌rjɛ], is a
                    Nordic country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and north, Finland to the east,
                    and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund Strait. At
                    450,295 square kilometres, Sweden is the largest country in Northern Europe, the
                    third-largest country in the European Union, and the fifth largest country in Europe. The capital
                    city is Stockholm. Sweden has a total population of 10.4 million; and a low population density
                    of 25 inhabitants per square kilometre. 87% of Swedes live in urban areas, which cover
                    1.5% of the entire land area. The highest concentration is in the central and southern half of the
                    country.</p>
                <p>Sweden is part of the geographical area of Fennoscandia. The climate is in general mild for its
                    northerly latitude due to significant maritime influence. In spite of the high latitude, Sweden
                    often has warm continental summers, being located in between the North Atlantic, the Baltic Sea, and
                    vast Russia. The general climate and environment vary significantly from the south and north due to
                    the vast latitudal difference, and much of Sweden has reliably cold and snowy winters. Southern
                    Sweden is predominantly agricultural, while the north is heavily forested and includes a portion of
                    the Scandinavian Mountains.</p>
                <p>Germanic peoples have inhabited Sweden since prehistoric times, emerging into history as the Geats
                    (Swedish Götar) and Swedes (Svear) and constituting the sea peoples known as the Norsemen. An
                    independent Swedish state emerged during the early 12th century. After the Black Death in the middle
                    of the 14th century killed about a third of the Scandinavian population, the Hanseatic
                    League threatened Scandinavia's culture, finances and languages. This led to the forming of the
                    Scandinavian Kalmar Union in 1397, which Sweden left in 1523. When Sweden became involved in the
                    Thirty Years War on the Reformist side, an expansion of its territories began and eventually the
                    Swedish Empire was formed. This became one of the great powers of Europe until the early 18th
                    century. Swedish territories outside the Scandinavian Peninsula were gradually lost during the 18th
                    and 19th centuries, ending with the annexation of present-day Finland by Russia in 1809. The last
                    war in which Sweden was directly involved was in 1814 when Norway was militarily forced into a
                    personal union, which peacefully dissolved in 1905. Since then, Sweden has been at peace,
                    maintaining an official policy of neutrality in foreign affairs. In 2014, Sweden celebrated 200
                    years of peace, breaking even Switzerland's record for peace. Sweden was formally neutral
                    through both world wars and the Cold War, albeit Sweden has since 2009 openly moved towards
                    cooperation with NATO.
