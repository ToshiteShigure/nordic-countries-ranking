                <h1>Norway</h1>
                <p>Norway (Bokmål: Norge; Nynorsk: Noreg; Northern Sami: Norga; Lule
                    Sami: Vuodna; Southern Sami: Nöörje), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a Nordic country in
                    Northern Europe whose mainland territory comprises the western and northernmost portion of the
                    Scandinavian Peninsula. The remote Arctic island of Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard also
                    form part of Norway. Bouvet Island, located in the Subantarctic, is a dependency of Norway;
                    it also lays claims to the Antarctic territories of Peter I Island and Queen Maud Land.</p>
                <p>Norway has a total area of 385,207 square kilometres and a population of
                    5,385,300 as of November 2020. The country shares a long eastern border with Sweden (1,619 km long).
                    Norway is bordered by Finland and Russia to the north-east, and the Skagerrak strait
                    to the south, with Denmark on the other side. Norway has an extensive coastline, facing the North
                    Atlantic Ocean and the Barents Sea. The maritime influence also dominates Norway's climate with mild
                    lowland temperatures on the sea coasts, whereas the interior, while colder, is also a lot milder
                    than areas elsewhere in the world on such northerly latitudes. Even during polar night in the north,
                    temperatures above freezing are commonplace on the coastline. The maritime influence brings high
                    rainfall and snowfall to some areas of the country.</p>
                <p>Harald V of the House of Glücksburg is the current King of Norway. Erna Solberg has been prime
                    minister since 2013 when she replaced Jens Stoltenberg. As a unitary sovereign state with a
                    constitutional monarchy, Norway divides state power between the parliament, the cabinet and the
                    supreme court, as determined by the 1814 constitution. The kingdom was established in 872 as a
                    merger of many petty kingdoms and has existed continuously for 1,149 years. From 1537 to 1814,
                    Norway was a part of the Kingdom of Denmark–Norway, and from 1814 to 1905, it was in a personal
                    union with the Kingdom of Sweden. Norway was neutral during the First World War and remained so
                    until April 1940 when the country was invaded and occupied by Germany until the end of World War II.
