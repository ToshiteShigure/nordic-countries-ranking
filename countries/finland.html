                <h1>Finland</h1>
                <p>Finland (Finnish: Suomi [ˈsuo̯mi]; Swedish: Finland [ˈfɪ̌nland], Finland Swedish: [ˈfinlɑnd]),
                    officially the Republic of Finland (Finnish: Suomen
                    tasavalta, Swedish: Republiken Finland, is a Nordic country located in Northern Europe. Finland
                    shares land borders with Sweden to the west, Russia to the east,
                    and Norway to the north and is defined by the Gulf of Bothnia to the west and the Gulf of Finland to
                    the south that are part of the Baltic Sea.</p>
                <p>Finland has a population of approximately 5.5 million, making it the 25th-most populous country in
                    Europe. The main language is Finnish, a Finnic language of the Uralic language family. Swedish
                    is the second official language of Finland, and is mainly spoken in certain coastal areas of the
                    country and on Åland. Finland is a parliamentary republic consisting of 19 regions and 310
                    municipalities. The climate varies significantly relative to latitude, from Southern Finland's
                    humid continental climate to the boreal climate of the north. Finland is primarily a boreal forest
                    biome, with more than 180,000 recorded lakes, leading to the denomination "the land of a thousand
                    lakes". With an area of 338,455 square kilometres, Finland is the eighth-largest
                    country in Europe, and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union. Helsinki, the
                    capital of Finland, is the largest metropolitan area with over 1.5 million people, which produces a
                    third of the country's GDP. Tampere and Turku are the next largest urban areas.</p>
