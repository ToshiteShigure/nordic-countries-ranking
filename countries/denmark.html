                <h1>Denmark</h1>
                <p>Denmark (Danish: Danmark, pronounced [ˈtænmɑk], officially the Kingdom of
                    Denmark, is a Nordic country in Northern Europe. Denmark proper, which is the
                    southernmost of the Scandinavian countries, consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of
                    443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand, Funen and the North Jutlandic Island. The
                    islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate
                    climate. Denmark lies southwest of Sweden and south of Norway, and is bordered to the south by
                    Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is constitutionally a unitary state comprising Denmark proper and
                    the two autonomous territories in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland.
                    Denmark has a total area of 42,943 km<sup>2</sup> as of 2020, and the total area including
                    Greenland and the Faroe Islands is 2,210,579 km<sup>2</sup>. Denmark proper has a population of
                    5.83 million (as of 2020).</p>
                <p>The unified kingdom of Denmark emerged in the 8th century as a proficient seafaring nation in the
                    struggle for control of the Baltic Sea. Denmark, Sweden, and Norway were ruled together under one
                    sovereign ruler in the Kalmar Union, established in 1397 and ending with Swedish secession in 1523.
                    The areas of Denmark and Norway remained under the same monarch until 1814, Denmark–Norway.
                    Beginning in the 17th century, there were several devastating wars with the Swedish Empire, ending
                    with large cessions of territory to Sweden. After the Napoleonic Wars, Norway was ceded to Sweden,
                    while Denmark kept the Faroe Islands, Greenland, and Iceland. In the 19th century there was a surge
                    of nationalist movements, which were defeated in the First Schleswig War. After the Second Schleswig
                    War in 1864, Denmark lost the Duchy of Schleswig to Prussia. Denmark remained neutral during World
                    War I; however, in 1920 the northern half of Schleswig became Danish again. In April 1940, a German
                    invasion saw brief military skirmishes while the Danish resistance movement was active from 1943
                    until the German surrender in May 1945. An industrialised exporter of agricultural produce in the
                    second half of the 19th century, Denmark introduced social and labour-market reforms in the early
                    20th century that created the basis for the present welfare state model with a highly developed
                    mixed economy.</p>
