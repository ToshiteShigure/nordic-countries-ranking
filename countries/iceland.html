                <h1>Iceland</h1>
                <p>Iceland (Icelandic: Ísland; [ˈi:slant] is a Nordic island country in the
                    North Atlantic Ocean, with a population of 356,991 and an area of 103,000 km<sup>2</sup>,
                    making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe.The capital and largest city is
                    Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over
                    two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists
                    of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains, and glaciers, and many glacial rivers
                    flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate
                    climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine
                    influence keep summers chilly, with most of its islands having a polar climate.</p>
                <p>According to the ancient manuscript Landnámabók, the settlement of Iceland began in 874 AD when the
                    Norwegian chieftain Ingólfr Arnarson became the first permanent settler on the island. In the
                    following centuries, Norwegians, and to a lesser extent other Scandinavians, emigrated to Iceland,
                    bringing with them thralls (i.e., slaves or serfs) of Gaelic origin.</p>
                <p>The island was governed as an independent commonwealth under the Althing, one of the world's oldest
                    functioning legislative assemblies. Following a period of civil strife, Iceland acceded to Norwegian
                    rule in the 13th century. The establishment of the Kalmar Union in 1397 united the kingdoms of
                    Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. Iceland thus followed Norway's integration into that union, coming
                    under Danish rule after Sweden's secession from the union in 1523. Although the Danish kingdom
                    introduced Lutheranism forcefully in 1550, Iceland remained a distant semi-colonial territory in
                    which Danish institutions and infrastructures were conspicuous by their absence.
